# StringMist
Gradle plugin for encrypt string constant on Java<br>

The plugin seems like [StringFog](https://github.com/MegatronKing/StringFog), but I have added some thing interesting.<br>
(Actually there are some code I just copy from StringFog directly.)<br>

## Funny stuff
This plugin generate a strDec method for every Java class for preventing the reverse engineer hook the only strDec method on the original plugin conveniently.<br>
In the original one, it is easy to get the ciphertext and plaintext, I think that is pretty ... weak, not bring an enough challenge for the hacker, and it will be decrypted automatically on new version of JEB.<br>
So, think about that, generate hooking code for every different class and different method, seems like shitty and disgusting, right ?<br>

## Something that not perfect on original plugin
During plagiarism code from StringFog, I have found that it will replace some empty string("") with null.<br>
That's not right and will cause some exceptions, maybe I just use his code with wrong approach, anyway, I fixed it on my code.<br>

## Shortage
Can not customize encrypt algorithm unless you modify the source code of plugin, now is blowfish on native and simple XOR on Java, please note the init box of blowfish is unstandard.

## Usage
1. Build and add StringMit to your local maven repository;
2. Add local repositories and dependencies on target project(Project's build.gradle);
```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven{
            url uri('C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.m2\\repository')
        }
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.2'
        classpath 'com.wizd:stringmist:1.0'
    }
}
```
3. Apply plugin and set properties on Module's build.gradle;
```gradle
apply plugin: 'stringmist'

stringmist {
    nativeInterfaceClass = 'com.wizd.usegradleplugin.NativeInterface'
    excludeClasses = []
    includeJars = ['nanohttpd.jar', 'okhttp.jar']
}
```
